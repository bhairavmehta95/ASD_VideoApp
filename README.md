# ASD_VideoApp

This is a project that involves OpenCV and Google's Speech APIs to help children (especially those with Autism Spectrum Disorder) of all ages gain more out of television programs such as Dora and Blue's Clues. By pairing Facial Tracking as well as forcing the viewer to interact with the program, teachers and parents can gain better insight where the child needs help.

While this project is still an early iteration, future builds will have:

* A feedback system
* A transcript at the end of each video (Question, Child's Answer)
* A "focus score" : A score that tells the adult how long the student was looking at the screen (and therefore, how long the student was paying attention)
